# Fruit Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Overview
This project analyzes different fruit types, their forms, pricing, and yield using Power BI.

## Project Structure
- `dataset/`: Cleaned dataset used for analysis
- `dashboard/`: Power BI dashboard file
- `presentation/`: Final presentation slides
- `code/`: Python or Power Query scripts (if used)

## ðŸ“Š Methodology
- Data cleaning (removed duplicates, filtered -9999 values)
- Visual analysis in Power BI (cluster-based, form-based)
- Interactive tooltips and slicers added for exploration

## Results
- Fresh and canned forms have highest price contribution
- Pineapple is the most common fruit
- Processed Premium % is very low (0.05%)

 ## Recommendations
- Focus production on high-performing clusters and forms
- Investigate why processed premium % is so low

 ## Future Work
- Add predictive analysis using machine learning
- Integrate real-time fruit market API
